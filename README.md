# Installation
- Download or clone the repository to a local directory on your OS. 
- Using pip or equivalent, install all the required packages or modules.
- Run main.py using command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux).

# Known Bugs / Limitations
- The app currently runs on Alpha Vantage's community tier (free) API. It is limited to 5 requests/minute and 500 requests/day, since it is free from Alpha Vantage. The limitation can be easily lifted if the user has access to larger API request volume.
- Import / Exports currently only allow limited file formats.

# Upcoming Features
- Cryptocurrency - support the tracking of popular cryptocurrency such as BTC, ETH, or LTC.
- Live updates - removes the need to manually update the API to see latest stock prices.
